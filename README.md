  <h1>Project: React Testing Lib</h1>
</div>

## Description

This test suite checks the behavior of the React PostComment component, which represents a comment form in an application. The first test ensures that the component is rendered correctly by checking whether the "Comment" button is present in the interface. The second test simulates adding two consecutive comments. It uses the @testing-library/react testing library to interact with DOM elements by entering text in comment fields and clicking the submit button. After adding comments, the test checks whether the number of comment elements rendered is equal to 2, thus validating the correct functioning of the comment addition functionality.
